# FHR-CNN-Research

The summer before my senior year of high school, I spent my time researching under the supervision of  Dr. Djuric of the StonyBrook EECE Department. While I reached out to Dr. Djuric as his general research was on the use of ML in classifying Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) signals, my own research was self-motivated and also focused on classifying FHR signals, but specifically by converting the signals into 2D images and then inputting these images into a CNN which I programmed to be able to classify the signals as demonstrating possible signs of irregularities in the FHR or not showing said signs. The program I created to sort all the data, convert the 1D signals into 2D images, and then the CNN I designed to classify these images can be found under the "full code.py" file attached to this repository. I also wrote a paper on this work with more details on the project as a whole, it is linked under the "FHR-CNN-Research Final Paper" file for those who are interested! This paper was not published, however it was submitted to the Regeneron Talent Search competition in 2022. It was an honor to work with Dr. Djuric and conduct such fascinating research that really jumpstarted my interest in EECE and programming as a a whole!
